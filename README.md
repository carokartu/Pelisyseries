# Movies and series API

This is the final project that Ada ITW disciples were challenged with. I could not feel more grateful than I do for every resource I´ve been enriched with along this last year. 
We've been taught to develop tailored pieces of script for solving each specific need at a time as well as every best practice to deliver slick code blocks that enable an intuitive site's performance and a smooth user experience. 
But above every particular tech tool we've acquired, we've been proven that perseverance, commitment and focus are everything we need to grow as high and as fast as we aim to. 

I've never been acquanted with such a full instruction in a bootcamp before, nor have I ever heard of any other short course of studies alike. We are one hundred percent Front End React Developers after one year of nonstop practise, and we are ready to put our hands to baking some incredible apps.

## Techs involved

Javascript, React, Styled components, Responsive Design, API REST. 

### Where to visit it
